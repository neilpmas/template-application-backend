/**
 * Gives Flyway a JDBC {@link DataSource} of its own.
 *
 * <p>Spring Boot's {@code DataSourceAutoConfiguration} backs off whenever an R2DBC
 * {@code ConnectionFactory} bean is present, on the assumption that a reactive app has no
 * use for JDBC. This app does use R2DBC for its own data access (see {@code spring.r2dbc.*}),
 * but Flyway ships no R2DBC driver -- it can only migrate over JDBC. With no
 * {@code DataSource} bean and no {@code spring.flyway.url}, Flyway's autoconfiguration has
 * nothing to connect with and quietly contributes nothing at all.
 *
 * <p>The failure mode is the dangerous kind: the application starts perfectly, health is
 * green, and no error or warning is logged anywhere -- migrations simply never run. It only
 * surfaces later, as the first query against a table that was never created.
 *
 * <p>So the JDBC side is wired explicitly here, from the same {@code spring.datasource.*}
 * properties the rest of the template's configuration uses, and marked
 * {@link FlywayDataSource} so Flyway picks it in preference to anything else. It is used
 * for migrations only; the application's own reads and writes still go through R2DBC.
 *
 * <p>Note this is a separate connection pool from the R2DBC one, pointed at the same
 * database. It is short-lived in practice -- Flyway opens it during startup and the pool
 * then sits idle -- so no pool sizing is configured beyond the defaults.
 *
 * <p>Gated on {@code spring.flyway.enabled} to match the condition on Boot's own
 * {@code FlywayAutoConfiguration}. Without the gate this would build a {@code DataSource}
 * even for slice tests that switch Flyway off and exclude {@code DataSourceAutoConfiguration}
 * precisely because they need no database, and those contexts would then fail to start on
 * an unresolvable {@code DATABASE_URL}.
